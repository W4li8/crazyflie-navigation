# These comments you're reading, starting with '#', shall be removed from mission file.

    "pilot_name": "Sully", # fun debug parameter, every drone needs a pilot

    # uniform resource identifier, radio address to connect to the drone
    "drone_uri": "radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E7E7",
    # initial pose (approx) of the drone, a list [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] in cm and deg, resp.
    "init_pose": [40, 40, 20, 0, 0, 60],
    # flight and hover altitude the drone will try to maintain in m
    "flight_altitude": 0.4,
    # speed of drone displacements in m/s
    "cruise_speed": 0.3,

    # rectangular world dimensions, a list [width, height] in cm
    "world_dim": [500, 300],
    # distance to maintain with surrounding obstacles in the plane in m
    "safety_distance": 0.3,

    #! additional dictionary of flight settings we can add later
    "mission_settings": {
        "param": "default value"
